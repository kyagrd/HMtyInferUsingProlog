\section{Related Work}\label{sec:relwork}
\subsection{A Framework for Extending HM}
The idea of using logic programming (LP) to specify type inference is not new.
\citet*{HMX99} defined a general framework called \HMX\ for specifying
extensions of HM (e.g., records, type classes, intersection types)
and \citet{tyinferCHR02} implemented \HMX\ using Prolog.
. Testing a type system extension
in the \HMX\ framework provides a certain level of confidence that the extension
would work well with type polymorphism in HM. Testing an extension by
extending our specification provides additional confidence that the extension
would work well with type constructor polymorphism and kind polymorphism,
as well as with type polymorphism.

\subsection{Delayed Goals and Control Flow in Logic Programming}
The concept of delayed goals has been used in many different contexts in LP.
An AILog
% \footnote{A logical inference system for designing intelligent agents.}
	 textbook \cite{AILogTextBook},
introduces delaying goals as one of the useful abilities of a meta-interpreter.
Several Prolog systems including SWI and SICStus provide built-in support for
delaying a goal until certain conditions are met using the predicates
such as {\small\verb|freeze|} or {\small\verb|when|}. In our specification,
%% supporting type constructor polymorphism and kind polymorphism,
we could not simply use {\small\verb|freeze|} or {\small\verb|when|}
because we pre-process the collected delayed goals (see \verb|variablize|
in \S\ref{ssec:HMtck}).
Recently, \citet{SchDemDesWei13} implemented delimited continutations for
Prolog, which might be a useful abstraction for the delayed goals 
used in our work.

\subsection{Other Logic Programming Systems}\label{ssec:otherLP}
Some experimental Prolog implementations support interesting features such as
nominal abstraction in \aProlog\ \cite{cheney04iclp} and a (restricted version
of) higher-order unification in \lProlog\ \cite{nadathur99cade}. However, we
have not found a relational specification of a polymorphic type systems using
them. The \aProlog\ developer attempted to implement the HM type inference for
mini-ML in \aProlog, but failed to produce a working version.\footnote{
	See \texttt{miniml.apl} in the examples directory of
	the \aProlog\ version 0.4 or 0.3.}
The Teyjus \lProlog\ compiler version 2 includes a PCF example,
which is similar to HM but without polymorphic let-bindings.
In both example implementations, they define the type inference predicate
tailored for type inference only (unlike our relational specification that
works for both type checking and inference) and the unification used in
their type inference are manually crafted rather than relying on
the native unification of the LP systems.

Kanren\footnote{ Kanren is a phonetic transcription of the Kanji word
	\begin{CJK}{UTF8}{min}{関連}\end{CJK} meaning ``\emph{relation}''.}
is a delcarative LP system embedded in a pure functional subset of Scheme.
A relational implementation of HM is provided in
the Kanren repository,
% \footnote{See \url{http://kanren.sourceforge.net/\#Sample}}
which works for both type checking, type inference, and also for
type inhabitance searching, as in our HM specification in Prolog.
A simplified version called miniKanren
% \footnote{ \url{http://minikanren.org/} }
has been implemented in several dialects of Scheme and an even further
simplified kernel \muKanren\ \cite{microKanren} is being implemented
in growing number of
host languages as an embedded Domain Specific Language (eDSL) for LP.
By design, Kanren does not provide concrete syntax, therefore, not best suited
for a specification language. However, Kanren has its benefits of being
flexible, simple, and portable. If one is to build a tool based on LP concepts
and wishes to support interfaces to one or more programming languages,
\muKanren\ may be a good choice to target as the backend.

Recently, there has been research on type inference using LP with non-standard
semantics (e.g., corecursive, coinductive) for object-oriented languages
(e.g., featherweight Java) but functional languages were left for
future work \cite{AL-ECOOP09}.
\citet{SRLP15} have developed S-resolution, which is proven \cite{PCR15} to
produce the same results when the depth-first-search style SLD-resolution
used in Prolog terminates, but S-resolution can answer more
queries that makes SLD-resolution loop, because it behaves less eagerly.
%% S-resolution encompasses both inductive
%% and coinductive reasonings by supporting sound productivity checking criteria
%% for recursively defined predicates.
S-resolution might be useful for us to eliminate the need for delayed goals
in our specification.

\subsection{Descriptions of Type Inference Algorithms in ITPs}
There are several formal descriptions of type inference algorithms using
Interactive Theorem Provers (ITPs) such as Coq \cite{Dubois00} and
Isabelle/HOL \cite{UrbanN2009}. The primary motivation %% NaraschewskiN-JAR,
in such work is to formally prove theoretical properties (e.g., soundness,
principal typing) of type inference algorithms, which is different from
our motivation of providing a human readable \& machine executable
specification for the type system to reduce the gap between
theoretical specification and practical implementation. Some of those
descriptions  are not even executable because the unification is merely
specified as a set of logical axioms.
Formally describing certifiable type inference in ITPs is challenging
(therefore also challenging to extend or modify) for two reasons. First, fresh
names should be monitored more explicitly and rigorously for the sake of
formal proof. Second, algorithms may need to be massaged differently from
their usual representations, in order to convince the termination checker of
the ITP (e.g. \cite{JFP:185139}).
