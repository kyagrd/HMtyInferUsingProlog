\section{Related Work}\label{sec:relwork}
The idea of using logic programming to specify type inference is not new.
\citet*{HMX99} defined a general framework called \HMX\ for specifying
extensions of HM (e.g., records, type classes, intersection types)
and \citet{tyinferCHR02} implemented \HMX\ using Prolog with
constraint handling rules (CHR).

The situation I understand is that work around HM(X) does not consider
type constructor polymorphism.
