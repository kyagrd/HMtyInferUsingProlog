\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}

Typing Haskell in Haskell

TODO page limit is 18 pages. I think there is adequate space left.
Main matter (\S\ref{sec:poly} and \S\ref{sec:other}) is written
so no more significant changes, b ut clarification and grammar typo fix etc.
Other sections are still ongoing.

TODO
Write future work briefly, related work discussions, and write a good intro/motivation,
and then submit!

type constructor polymorphism (a.k.a. higher-kinded polymorphism)

TODO mention that all our Prolog specification runs in SWI Prolog 7.2.
and available online point to github repo


logic programming languages such as Prolog are natural candidates

based on Hindley--Milner type inference
